  <section class="Poem">
    <div class="stanza 1">
      <h2>Stanza 1</h2>
      <p> Two roads diverged in a yellow wood, </p>
      <p> And sorry I could not travel both</p>
      <p> And be one traveler, long I stood </p>
      <p> And looked down one as far as I could </p>
      <p>To where it bent in the undergrowth;</p>

    </div>

    <div class="stanza 2">
      <h2>Stanza 2</h2>
      <p> Then took the other, as just as fair</p>
      <p> And having perhaps the better claim,</p>
      <p>Because it was grassy and wanted wear;</p>
      <p>Though as for that, the passing there</p>
      <p>Had worn them really about the same,</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza 3">
      <h2>Stanza 3</h2>
      <p> And both that morning equally lay</p>
      <p>In leaves no step had trodden black</p>
      <p>Oh, I kept the first for another day!</p>
      <p>Yet knowing how way leads on to way,</p>
      <p>I doubted if I should ever come back.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="stanza 4">
      <h2>Stanza 4</h2>
      <p>I shall be telling this with a sigh</p>
      <p>Somewhere ages and ages hence:</p>
      <p>Two roads diverged in a wood, and I,</p>
      <p>I took the one less traveled by,</p>
      <p>And that has made all the difference.</p>
